# IoT Home Automation System

## 🔍 Overview

The **IoT Home Automation System** enables remote control of home appliances using the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module and a relay module. It also integrates machine learning to analyze energy consumption and estimate electricity bills. All usage data is stored in the cloud and can be accessed via a web or mobile interface for real-time monitoring and control.
