#IoT Home Automation System
##Overview
The IoT Home Automation System allows remote control of home appliances using the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module and relay modules. The system integrates machine learning to analyze energy consumption and estimate electricity bills. Data is stored in the cloud, and appliances are controlled via a mobile app or web interface.

##Features
Remote control of appliances using mobile/web interface. ESP8266-based Wi-Fi communication. Relay control for various appliances. Machine learning for energy consumption analysis and bill estimation. Cloud storage for data management and real-time monitoring. Components

##Hardware:
ESP8266 Wi-Fi Module

4-Relay Module

Optional: Sensors (for additional features)

##Software:
Arduino IDE (for ESP8266 programming)

Python (for data analysis and machine learning)

Cloud platform (e.g., AWS)
